    "It's quite tricky to come up with a good set of angles right? In practice,we come up with the foot position curve first, and then solve for the angles that allow this. We call this `inverse kinematics`. Inverse kinematics is much harder than forward kinematics though, because there may be more than one solution to the angles, so we usually introduce other constraints to help us figure this out.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also important to remember that we've just been doing this for a simple 2D robot leg, but our Dingo Robot actually has 3 motors to control 3 joints, which allows foot placement in 3D. This also allows it to make much more complex motions, but unfortunately makes the maths a bit more challenging to solve using standard trigonometry."
