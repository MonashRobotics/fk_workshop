# Forward Kinematics

In this workshop you will learn about robot kinematics (the study of positions and orientations of robot arms and legs), and robot walking gaits. We'll start with a quick introduction and then run the workshop in 3 parts. First, we'll look at a simple leg and figure out how to map joint angles to foot positions. Then we will try to come up with a foot position trajectory to test on our Dingo robot quadruped.
